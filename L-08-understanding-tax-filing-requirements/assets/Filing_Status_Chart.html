    <h2>Filing Status Eligibility Checklists</h2>
    <p>Use these checklists to help determine which filing status you might qualify for:</p>

    <h3>Single</h3>
    <p>You qualify as Single if:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>You are unmarried on the last day of the tax year</li>
        <li>You are legally separated or divorced under state law</li>
        <li>You don't qualify for another filing status</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Married Filing Jointly</h3>
    <p>You qualify for Married Filing Jointly if:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>You are legally married on the last day of the tax year</li>
        <li>Both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return</li>
        <li>Neither of you is a nonresident alien (with some exceptions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Married Filing Separately</h3>
    <p>You qualify for Married Filing Separately if:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>You are legally married on the last day of the tax year</li>
        <li>You and your spouse choose to file separate returns</li>
        <li>You want to be responsible only for your own tax</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Head of Household</h3>
    <p>You qualify for Head of Household if:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>You are unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the tax year</li>
        <li>You paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year</li>
        <li>A qualifying person lived with you in the home for more than half the year (except for temporary absences)</li>
        <li>For parents, the qualifying child doesn't need to live with you if you claim them as a dependent under a special rule for parents</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important-note">
        <strong>Note about "considered unmarried":</strong> You can be considered unmarried for Head of Household purposes if your spouse didn't live in your home during the last 6 months of the tax year, you file a separate return, you paid more than half the cost of keeping up your home, your home was the main home of your child for more than half the year, and you can claim the child as a dependent.
    </div>

    <h3>Qualifying Widow(er) with Dependent Child</h3>
    <p>You qualify for Qualifying Widow(er) if:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Your spouse died in either of the two years before the current tax year</li>
        <li>You haven't remarried</li>
        <li>You have a dependent child</li>
        <li>You provide more than half the cost of maintaining the home where you and the child live</li>
        <li>You could have filed a joint return with your spouse in the year of death</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Factors That Affect Filing Status Choice</h2>

    <h3>Income Level and Mix</h3>
    <p>The source and amount of income can influence which filing status is most advantageous:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-income families:</strong> Married Filing Jointly is often beneficial, but some couples with similar high incomes might face a "marriage penalty"</li>
        <li><strong>One income significantly higher than the other:</strong> Married Filing Jointly almost always makes sense</li>
        <li><strong>One spouse with high medical expenses:</strong> Married Filing Separately might be beneficial since medical expenses must exceed a percentage of AGI to be deductible</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dependent Situation</h3>
    <p>Having dependents can influence your filing status options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unmarried with dependents: May qualify for Head of Household (more favorable than Single)</li>
        <li>Recently widowed with dependents: May qualify for Qualifying Widow(er) status</li>
        <li>Separated with dependents: May qualify for Head of Household if you meet specific requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Legal Considerations</h3>
    <p>Legal considerations that may affect filing status include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>State of legal residence (particularly for same-sex marriages)</li>
        <li>Separation agreements and divorce timing</li>
        <li>Custody arrangements for children</li>
        <li>Legal responsibility for tax debt (especially relevant for Married Filing Jointly vs. Separately)</li>
    </ul>
