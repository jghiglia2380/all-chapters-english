I'd create a step-by-step plan, build in time for learning, and set up checkpoints to get feedback early. I'd also be transparent with my manager about my learning curve while demonstrating my commitment to delivering quality work. I see unfamiliar tasks as opportunities to expand my skills."

                    question: "How would you prioritize multiple urgent deadlines?",
                    sample: "I'd first assess each task's true urgency and impact—sometimes 'urgent' requests can wait while others have real consequences. I'd communicate with stakeholders to understand flexibility and dependencies. Then I'd create a prioritized list based on deadlines, importance, and effort required. For truly competing priorities, I'd escalate to my manager with options: 'I can deliver A by Tuesday or B by Tuesday—which should take priority?' I'd also identify if any tasks could be delegated."

I'd focus on the project's needs rather than blame: 'I've noticed the research section isn't progressing. How can we get this back on track?' If the issue persists, I'd document specific instances and involve the team lead or manager while focusing on solutions rather than complaints."

I'd take time to reflect on the feedback objectively—even if it's hard to hear, there's usually something valuable to learn. Then I'd create a specific action plan to address the concerns and follow up to show I've implemented changes. I view feedback as essential for growth."
