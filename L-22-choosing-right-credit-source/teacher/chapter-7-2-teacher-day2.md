## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (7 minutes)

- Begin by connecting to Day 1 content: "Yesterday we explored different sources of credit. Today we'll apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios."
- Direct students to the podcast review section where they can listen to a brief recap of key concepts
- Key podcast content includes:
  - Review of credit sources (commercial banks, credit unions, finance companies, online lenders, payday lenders)
  - Importance of APR in comparing options
  - Factors that influence creditworthiness
  - Warning signs of predatory lending

**Facilitation Tip**: As students listen to the podcast, circulate to ensure technology is working. After listening, ask 2-3 quick review questions to check for understanding before moving to the first station.

### Station 1: Credit Source Analysis Challenge (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to Station 1 in the Learning Lab platform
- Explain that they'll analyze several borrowing scenarios and recommend appropriate credit sources
- Point out that they should use knowledge from Day 1 about different credit providers
- Show students where to record their recommendations and explanations

#### During the Activity
- Students should analyze 4-5 realistic borrowing scenarios such as:
  - A college student needing $500 for an emergency car repair with limited credit history
  - A young professional wanting to consolidate $8,000 in credit card debt with a good credit score
  - A family needing $20,000 for a home renovation with excellent credit and home equity
  - A person with poor credit needing $1,200 for medical expenses not covered by insurance
- For each scenario, students:
  - Identify 2-3 appropriate credit sources
  - Rank them from best to worst
  - Calculate approximate total costs for at least one option
  - Explain their reasoning
  - Suggest alternatives to borrowing if applicable

#### Group Sharing
- After 10-12 minutes of work, briefly discuss one scenario as a class
- Ask students to share their recommendations and reasoning
- Highlight thoughtful analysis and creative alternatives
- Address any common misunderstandings

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How did you determine which credit source was most appropriate for each scenario?"
- "What factors beyond APR did you consider in your recommendations?"
- "For Scenario X, what alternatives to borrowing might be available?"
- "How might having a better credit score change the available options in these scenarios?"

### Station 2: Credit Cost Calculator (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Credit Cost Calculator in the Learning Lab
- Explain that this interactive tool allows them to compare the true cost of different credit options
- Demonstrate how to enter loan amounts, interest rates, terms, and fees
- Show how the calculator generates visualizations of total cost, monthly payments, and payoff time

#### During the Activity
- Students should compare at least three different credit options for a specific purpose (e.g., $5,000 for used car)
  - Option 1: Bank loan at 8% APR for 36 months
  - Option 2: Credit card at 18% APR with minimum payments (3% of balance)
  - Option 3: Finance company loan at 24% APR for 24 months
- Have students record key metrics for each option:
  - Monthly payment
  - Total interest paid
  - Total cost (principal + interest + fees)
  - Time to repay
- Students should create a chart comparing all options and select the best choice with justification

#### Support Strategies
- For students struggling with the calculator, provide a guided example with pre-set numbers
- Encourage students to test extreme scenarios to see the dramatic impact of high interest rates
- For advanced students, challenge them to find the "break-even point" between two different options

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students understand the relationship between term length and total cost
- Ensure students are correctly interpreting the results
- Watch for students who may be focusing only on monthly payment rather than total cost
- Be ready to explain why minimum payments on credit cards can lead to very long repayment periods

### Station 3: Borrower's Decision Matrix (8 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that a decision matrix helps evaluate options using personalized criteria
- Show students how to create their own framework for making credit decisions
- Demonstrate a simple matrix with criteria like interest rate, fees, flexibility, and customer service

#### During the Activity
- Students will create a personalized decision matrix with:
  1. Criteria for evaluating credit options (at least 5-7 factors)
  2. Weighting for each criterion based on personal priorities
  3. Rating system for scoring different options
  4. Example application to a specific borrowing scenario
- Encourage students to consider factors beyond just cost:
  - Repayment flexibility
  - Customer service quality
  - Convenience/application process
  - Relationship with the lender
  - Additional benefits/features
  - Impact on credit score
  - Collateral requirements

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Why might your decision matrix look different from your classmate's?"
- "How might your criteria and weightings change for different types of purchases?"
- "Which criteria did you weight most heavily and why?"
- "How could this matrix help you avoid impulsive borrowing decisions?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there is no universally "correct" decision matrix—the framework should reflect individual priorities and financial situations.

### Station 4: Predatory Lending Case Study (8 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the predatory lending case study in the Learning Lab
- Explain that they'll analyze a real example of predatory lending practices
- Review what makes lending predatory: excessive fees, deceptive practices, targeting vulnerable borrowers
- Set expectations for respectful discussion, acknowledging that some families may use these services

#### During the Activity
- Students will read a case study about a person facing a financial emergency who turns to a high-cost lender
- The case study includes details about loan terms, costs, and consequences
- Students identify the predatory elements in the scenario
- Students develop alternative approaches the person could have taken
- Students research community resources that could help in similar situations
- Students create an "emergency plan" to avoid needing high-cost credit in urgent situations

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What warning signs of predatory lending do you see in this case study?"
- "Why do you think the person in the case study chose this option despite the high costs?"
- "What systemic factors might make it difficult for some people to access lower-cost credit?"
- "What emergency resources exist in our community that could help in similar situations?"

**Guidance Note**: Approach this topic with sensitivity, recognizing that some students may come from families that use alternative financial services due to barriers to traditional banking.

### Reflection & Wrap-up: Personal Credit Plan (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to the Personal Credit Plan section
- Explain that this synthesizes all their learning from the Learning Lab
- Students create a personalized plan that includes:
  - Their "credit sources hierarchy" (which sources they would consider first, second, etc. for different needs)
  - Personal criteria for making borrowing decisions
  - Strategies for building/maintaining good creditworthiness
  - Emergency borrowing alternatives
  - Long-term credit management goals

#### Sharing Insights
- If time permits, ask 1-2 volunteers to share one insight from their Personal Credit Plan
- Encourage students to keep their plan as a reference for future financial decisions
- Remind students how this knowledge will be useful in upcoming chapters on credit cards and student loans

#### Closing Message:
This Learning Lab has equipped you with practical tools for making informed borrowing decisions. Remember that credit itself is neither good nor bad—it's a financial tool that can help you achieve goals when used wisely. Your ability to analyze credit options, calculate true costs, and identify predatory practices will serve you throughout your financial life.
