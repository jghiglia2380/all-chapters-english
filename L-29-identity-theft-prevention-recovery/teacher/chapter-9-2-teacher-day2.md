#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the case studies (tax identity theft and credit card fraud) as real-world examples
- Explain that analyzing actual cases helps develop practical response skills
- Emphasize the importance of both prevention insights and recovery steps
- Remind students to analyze the cases chronologically: how the theft occurred, immediate response, and long-term prevention

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to identify multiple possible sources of personal information theft in each case
- Encourage sequential ordering of recovery steps based on priority and logical flow
- Prompt students to consider both immediate actions and longer-term protection measures
- Help students connect case studies to their own information management practices

#### Group Sharing
- After individual analysis, facilitate brief sharing of insights from the cases
- Ask students to identify the most critical recovery step in each scenario and why
- Discuss differences in response needed for tax identity theft versus credit card fraud
- Highlight common themes in prevention strategies across different identity theft types

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How might you recognize these types of identity theft if they happened to you?"
- "Which organizations would you need to contact immediately in each scenario?"
- "What documentation would be important to maintain during the recovery process?"
- "How could these types of identity theft affect your financial future if not addressed promptly?"
